General principles

1.4.
1.5. 1.6.
1.7.
1.8.
ORGANISATION recognises that colleagues (employees, volunteers, trustees, secondees and students) gain information about individuals and organisations during the course of their work or activities. In most cases such information will not be stated as confidential and colleagues may have to exercise common sense and discretion in identifying whether information is expected to be confidential. This policy aims to give guidance but if in doubt, seek advice from your line manager.
Colleagues are able to share information with their line manager in order to discuss issues and seek advice.
Colleagues will avoid exchanging personal information or comments about individuals with whom they have a professional relationship.
Talking about the private life of a colleague is to be avoided at all times, unless the colleague in question has instigated the conversation.
Colleagues will avoid talking about organisations or individuals in social settings.
Colleagues will not disclose to anyone, other than their line manager, any information considered sensitive, personal, financial or private without the knowledge or consent of the individual, or an officer, in the case of an organisation.
There may be circumstances where colleagues would want to discuss difficult situations with each other to gain a wider perspective on how to approach a problem. The organisation’s consent must be sought before discussing the situation, unless the colleague is convinced beyond doubt that the organisation would not object to this. Alternatively, a discussion may take place with names or identifying information remaining confidential.
Where there is a legal duty on ORGANISATION to disclose information, the person to whom the confidentiality is owed will be informed that disclosure has or will be made.
